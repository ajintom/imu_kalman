## Summary
Various kind of 9 Degrees of freedom IMU orientation estimation algorithm.

The aim of this project is to provide efficient orientation estimation algorithms using a 9 DOF IMU. The project started back in 2011 in the framework of an academic course (Microelectronics), as a google-code hosting. We used the iNEMO V2 as IMU, released at that time by ST Microelectronics (official site [iNemo](http://www.st.com/internet/evalboard/product/250367.jsp)). This project was carreied out in collaboration with ST Microelectronics, R&D group, AST Advanced System Technologies / Remote Monitoring.

## Content

We developed the following algorithms:

- Complementary filter: the simplest way to estimate orientation using a 9DOF IMU. Attached in the "Download" section Matlab and C# sources.

- Kalman filter: implementation of Kalman filter using quaternion as system state. Attached in the "Download" section Matlab and C# sources.

- AHRS estimation algorithm: this implementation is provided by the project [imumargalgorithm30042010sohm](http://code.google.com/p/imumargalgorithm30042010sohm/). We inserted the source as a class into our C# project, fitting it to our IMU (downloadable in the "Download" section).

The "docs" folder contains the following documents:
- "ProgettoMicroelettronica_Relazione_V16.pdf ", the first report written in 2011. ITALIAN LANGUAGE.
- "MicroelectronicsProject_Report_V11.pdf", a brief translation of the italian report mentioned before.
- "GaussNewton_QuaternionComplemFilter_V13.pdf", a document explaining the implementation of a quaternion based complementary filter using a Gauss-Newton method for the observation of quaternions.

Since 2015 we are running our own business with inertial systems within 221e SRL, always in collaboration with the University of Bergamo.
